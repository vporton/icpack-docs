        <p><strong>IC Pack</strong> is the package manager and app store(s) that installs <q>packages</q> (apps) into the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain and ensures that nobody except of the sovereign user can remove or update his/her app.</p>
        <p>We are releasing an MVP/beta preview of IC Pack for developers. This is similar to Google Play or Apple App Store, but for online apps. <strong>This is a developer preview, not a finished product, and we provide no warranty whatsoever. Particularly, we don't provide warranty that your cycles spend using this software won't become inaccessible for you.</strong></p>
        <h2>For Developers And Testers</h2>
        <p><a href="https://app.package-manager.com">MVP beta-1 online.</a> (<strong>Attention:</strong> It was tested a little and all seems to work.)</p>
        <p>Currently the only package available is <code>example</code> from the repo <code>d54aj-5yaaa-aaaad-aamlq-cai</code>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/vporton/icp-package-manager">Source</a> (Your contributions will be valuable.)</p>
        <p><a href="html/icpack/index.html">API docs</a> (<strong>Warning:</strong> Due to a bug, some functions are shown as if they were without arguments despite they have arguments. If in doubt consult the source. This isn't very important now, because at this stage we only create a repository for users, not call other API on it.)</p>
        <p>For how to create a package, see examples in <a href="sources/prepare-test.ts.html">scripts/prepare-test.ts</a> (a TypeScript source file that creates a repository (app store) with several packages). To upload a package, you may create your own repository (app store), but in the future some repositories are expected to be under control of <a href="https://internetcomputer.org/sns/faq">SNS</a> DAOs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You first create the repository (and optionally set its properties such as name).</li>
            <li>Then you upload WASM files of your app.</li>
            <li>Then you create a package, that can be installed using IC Pack from your repository (app store).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are able to bootstrap your own copy of package manager after sending 13T cycles or more (You want to send more, if you like to actually install something.) to the account shown in our bootstrapping app. <q>To bootstrap</q> means to install the package manager itself and make it (<code>icpack</code>) one of the installed packages. A big part of the 13T (or more) cycles will be transferred to the <code>battery</code> module (your own canister) of <code>icpack</code> package and you can withdraw cycles from them back.</p>
